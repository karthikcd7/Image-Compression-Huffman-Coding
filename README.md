# Image-Compression-Huffman-Coding
A web app built on Flask that lets users upload images and download the compressed image.
Uses Huffman Compression Algorithm to compress the bits of each pixel generated, using Heaps in C.

STEPS:
*1.Covert image to text.
*2.Compress the text using Huffman Coding.
*3.Convert the compressed text back to Image.

It is a lossless compression technique and can be applied on all types of image files.
